Christopher Nolan is one of only a few filmmakers today that can craft a thought provoking and emotionally engaging film with action that never feels overlong or unnecessary.

Lots of people are attracted to movies because of their fave celebrities, it's hypocritical to imply that the ONLY reason one watches a movie is to understand its ""historical aspect"" or just for the story. If they came here to see their favorite celeb then great! More publicity for the film and despite what everyone says I'm sure that was one of the director's reason for casting Harry Styles.

"Why would they bring a film out for something that was a complete failure and embarrassment to the British military?.
 
 Also, why do humans constantly hold onto the past?. Does it not compute yet, that relentlessly bringing up WWI and WWII all the time is actually detrimental to moving forward and working towards a global common peace.
 
 But what stops it, is all this constant remembering wars that none of you here will have witnessed, were alive to witness etc, etc. Would it have mattered to you or I whether Germany won or not, because we would not have known better?.
 
 When you sit and ask why they keep bringing up the past to try and glorify their victory in WWII or WWI, you wonder whether they really have the brains to understand that whilst they continue to bring out films like this and continue to obsess over the constant wars of yesteryear, that is part of the reason why we still have wars today.
 
 Constant going on about previous wars, nadda, has to stop, we need to look to the future not the bloody past all the time.

"An hour and a half of living I'll never get back; it was utter bollox. Having said that, the first 3 minutes was great, but then it flat-lined. Simply, a dreadfully scripted, produced and directed movie that only offers disrespect to the 100's of thousands of military involved in that theatre of war - known as Dunkirk. Less than a B Grade Bollywood flick and obviously made on a shoe-string budget and by golly, it showed in spades. CG graphics? - well there was none; unless of course you count 6ft model planes crashing into the sea, 20 minutes spent in the hull of some old tug boat with unknown hostiles taking pot shots; the ji, ji, ji ..tempo of the music was continuous and oppressive, something like that from Jaws, but never ending; damn it, the orchestral was probably the worst part and almost intolerable. And where was the flotilla of 100's of tiny boats? dah,; Dunkirk was about little people in little boats rescuing thousands and thousands of shattered troops!! CG please! For me, this was a wasted opportunity to create an epic movie and I think it would have been better to have never made Dunkirk, unless of course justice could have been done in the telling. uuuugh, simply a wasted Sunday arvo and I am embarressed to have sat through it, based on the promise of an epic retelling, of all that was Dunkirk",-0.9216,negative

"Dunkirk is not your traditional war film. If you want a film that breaks almost every war movie convention and is a bit avant-garde then Dunkirk is for you. Having said that, this film was very underwhelming regardless of how historically accurate it is. Starting with the positives, this film is shot on beautiful film, has great props and wardrobe, it utilizes practical effects, has excellent sound effects, and has a musical score that drives the film. On the negative side of things the musical score drives the film forward constantly building you up, but once the build up stops you don't receive that satisfying of a conclusion. Very often the heavy accents and dialogue is difficult to understand, there's too many characters and none of them show any character development and lack character depth. Compared to Saving Private Ryan and or Pearl Harbor this film is really underwhelming in terms of action sequences. The best scenes visually are the flight sequences, bomb droppings, and even those are underwhelming. I also feel that if this film was rated R instead of PG-13 it could have added more realism. I feel like if this film would have shown the French soldiers who were also evacuated from Dunkirk and the French who sacrificed themselves to defend the city against a superior enemy in weaponry and numbers it could have fed my need for more action and the need to escape Dunkirk thus making the conclusion more satisfying. This film is worth a watch, but that is all.",0.4856,positive

"Dunkirk was the last act in perhaps the biggest military ass-kicking in history. An army of a third of a million men was pushed entirely off the European Continent in only sixteen days. Germany invaded France on May 10, 1940 and by May 26th the oh-so-superior British Empire was hauling ass of a whole continent. 
 
 Only the British could pretend Dunkirk was a success.
 
 The British army took no offensive military action against a German for the next 29 months until the US also attacked the Germans in North Africa. In the whole 60 months the British Empire, with 419 million people, fought in WWII, it only lost 383,000 troops. In the 45 months America, with less than a third as many people--131 million people, fought in WWII, it lost 403,000, meaning the monthly rate of American loses was 40% higher that its British Empire ally with more than three times the people. 
 
 If Dunkirk is any example, it probably was a good thing the so avoided fighting.",-0.9633,negative
