Good choice,"Just got my hands on this product. Let me be honest. Build quality pretty good. Everything fine no cracks or openings. Now the most important point - Bass. I have seen many people and many YouTubers telling that bass is bit much. For for me it is pretty well balanced and works out pretty well. I cannot tell much about battery backup. Let me use this for a couple of days. Then I will update my post. Sound quality also good and if you are used to listening to high volume of sound, you can easil...READ MORE"

Wonderful,This neckband looks good for its price especially for the battery backup and fast charging. Sound is good but bass could have been more and better. Have to use and check more for better opinion. Call quality is good though... Cons are that it doesn't fit that well into the ears and right side feels little heavy cos of remote buttons on the right cable.READ MORE
Mind-blowing purchase,"The battery life is really amazing, on average use of 4-5 hrs per day it lasts upto 5-6 days on 50-60% volume. Also the fast charging really works, you will get 10hrs battery backup with 10 minutes of charge, whereas it takes 1.5 hrs for full charge which is good.The mic does have noise cancellation and quality of voice over mic is very good.The build quality is also nice, it feels durable and the fit is good and snuggly.My opinion:-  Its the best bluetooth collar band in this price segme...READ MORE"
Terrible product,"Its only 7 months I bought this product. It was convenient for me to use. Sound,Bass everything is good but. It said it has water & sweat resistance power. I never worked out wearing these not splashed any water but still one side stopped working in 1 second without any warning. I feel like I wasted my money in this. Wired earphones work longer than this.READ MORE"
Just wow!,"I am writing this review after using it for 4 months. Product material is very poor quality. 2 times broken without doing anything. Plastic quality is very very poor.

Must buy!,As compared to any other company models and even boat  most famous model this is the best product. With a dedicated mic and enormous battery backup. I don't suppose any other blutooth headset can compete with this. I have tried and tested with my office calls and response was amazing. Due to to Covid situation Work from home this product is the best support. It connects with my Laptop and mobile at the same time. And I can easily switch between concalls and online calls work great throughout ...READ MORE
Wonderful,First of all thanks to Flipkart & Boat. Now discuss about this headphone :- 1. Sound Quality & Bass :- This is an unique sound quality. I use lots of headphone but this is an unique & sweet sound quality. Bass is enough for listening. Volume upto 25-30% is enough for listen. I give 5/5 star for sound & 5/5 star for bass..2. Quality :- Quality is not bad. 4.5/5 star for quality.3. Calling :- There are no issues for calling. Just awesome calling quality. 4. Battery :- It's have a great ...READ MORE

Good choice,Every thing is just awesome but build quality  of boat products as usual sucks...If handled  carefully  can last about 1 yr or more but not then it can't survive  Only go for it if u r not a rough userBy seeing its quality  i can say its more durable than its 225 nd 255 pro version but not as durable as realme dizo neckands. So if a heavy user i suggest go for realme Or if u get this at below 1200(in sale/offer ) Then only go for itOther than that i am extremely happy with its mic and s...READ MORE
Terrific purchase,Good Product long lasting battery But when i compare it with my Infinity glide 120 the sound and bass are better there alas the its battery is only 6hrs so if you need good voice with better build quality with less battery go with glide 120 but if you.need A little less audio not much just a little and way long lasting battery go with this oneREAD MORE
Really Nice,"Reviewing after using for 1 month.Sound quality: Average sound quality.

Signal drops rarely even after 2 walls.Mic: No complaints.Built quality: Below average. Pretty sure the charging port is going to break first. C...READ MORE"

Just okay,"I'm writing this after 2 months if usage.Sound quality is too good. But it's not suitable for bike riders as it flying away from neck.

Fair,It's not such a good product not giving any good quality it's one side is always getting broken even if it's getting a little stratched it's not really value for money and the worst part is it's call quality every single background noise is reached to person you are talking to so i don't think you should buy it even music quality is okay and battery is good except that i would never recommend you but some buds in offer you will get good buds in 1200-1500 in place of this that will look cool a...READ MORE
Worth every penny,Best product below 2k. Sound quality is amazing. Its like a home theatre inside my ears. Battery is excellent. No issue with the buttons. Range is also good.

Does the job,"Not recommended because of desine failure. Build quality is very poor. Not comfortable to wear for long. Can't use inside helmet otherwise it will pain like hell. Good battery life is the only merit. Not fot inside ears even with the smallest pad option, ocationally poping out of ear and wearing long time it will make the ears swell from inside. So I won't recommend to anyone. Earpod design is the best for ear comfort. If you get any other head band with apple earbuds design go for it.READ MORE"
