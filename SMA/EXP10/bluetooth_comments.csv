"honestly i got these headphones on big billian sale for 1000 rupees.. for that price point, it being a headset is just overkill.. it comes with both wired and bluetooth so battery backup is not a big deal.. but the battery backup is very nice.. very deep bass and nice sound overall.. i mean it will be worth ur money if u get it for 1700 or so.. only bad thing is that as bluetooth version is lower (v2.1 i suppose)  the sound starts chopping if headsets are blocked by ur palm or if u decide t...read more"

"overall a great performer but doesn't excel in any particular department. for the price it is being offered at, it is a good deal. the cups are tight and the leather band beneath the headband has weak glue. the wireless functionality is basically useless if you are buying these for music because bluetooth has smaller bandwidth and doesn't allow high bitrate, hence poor quality, therefore, use the aux cable provided for music. the pair costs this much for its features not just sound. if you wa...read more"
"it's a very decent product.till now i've faced no issue with this.the eye catching feature i found is its two way of connecting with the device.it can be connected through bluetooth as well as with the aux cable as provided inside the box.so,when the headphone gets out of charge,it remains usable with that aux cable with proper functioning.read more"

i received a quick delivery from flipkart. the headphones are light weight and foldable which makes it easy to carry. sound quality is decent. bluetooth connectivity is very good. the only negetive aspect of this device is the call quality. it's terrible. you can hear the other person but the microphone on this device is so poor that you won't be audible on the other end. it definitely doesn't support handsfree calling. i tried using the cable to call but again it didn't improve much. this is...read more
